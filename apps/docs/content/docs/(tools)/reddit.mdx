description: Basic readonly Reddit API for getting top/hot/new/rising posts from subreddits.
---

- package: `@deepagent/reddit`
- exports: `class RedditClient`, `namespace reddit`
- [source](https://github.com/amardeeplakshkar/deepagent/blob/main/packages/reddit/src/reddit-client.ts)
- [reddit legacy api docs](https://old.reddit.com/dev/api)

<Note>
  This client uses Reddit's free, legacy JSON API aimed at RSS feeds, so no auth
  is required. With that being said, Reddit does impose rate limits on the API,
  so be considerate.
